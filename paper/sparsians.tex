  This document contains the instructions for preparing a submission or camera-ready
  manuscript for the proceedings of Semeval-2018. The document itself
  conforms to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of
  what your manuscript should look like. These instructions should be
  used for both papers submitted for review and for final versions of
  accepted papers.  Authors are asked to conform to all the directions
  reported in this document.

\section{Our methodology}
We used the popular skip-gram (SG) and continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW) approaches \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1301-3781} to train $d=100$ dimensional dense distributed word representations for each sub-corpora. For some subcorpus $x$, we denote the embedding matrix as $W_x \in \mathbb{R}^{\lvert V_x \rvert \times d}$ with $\lvert V_x \rvert$ denoting the size of the vocabulary and $d$ is set to 100 as stated previously.

As a subsequent step we turn the dense vectorial word representations into sparse word vectors akin to \citet{TACL1063} by solving for
\begin{equation}
\min\limits_{D \in \mathcal{C}, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}} \lVert D\alpha - W \rVert_F + \lambda \lVert \alpha \rVert_1,
\label{nonneg_SPAMS_objective}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{C}$ is the convex set of matrices containing only such vectors whose norm does not exceeds $1$ and $\alpha$ contains the sparse coefficients encoding which basis vectors from $D$ takes part in the reconstruction of the vectorial representation of some element of the vocabulary. The only difference compared to \cite{TACL1063} is that here we ensure a non-negativity constraint over the elements of $\alpha$.
